page_rank.py is a python file that implements the page_rank algorithm.

The txt files in the format "test#.txt" are test cases for the algorithm.

The program can be run by entering "python3 page_rank.py" in terminal in
the page-rank-implementation directory.

To change the graph, you can put in the name of the text file as a parameter
of the "convert_text_to_graph(text_file_name)" method in the main method.

The results should appear as a string, specifying the number of iterations
it took to reach the page rank, and the page rank for each page.
